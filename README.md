# Crafting Machines + Item Transportation

This is a plugin designed to help make crafting and transportation of items easier.

Items are transported along rails and are crafted within a crafting Machine.


## Getting items out of chests

To get items out of any accepted block, you need to use a activator rail (Also know as a sucky rail, because it sucks the items out).

As you can see in this image, once a redstone current is applied the the activator rail it will pull out a single item. To pull more items out, you just need to apply redstone again.


## Putting items into chests

Putting items into chests is really easy, all you need to do is run rail into the side of the chest, and it'll take in the item. The only case in which it won't take in the item is if the inventory is full any it can't fit anywhere. In this case the item will pop of the tracks.


## Fast rails

If a rail is powered, it can be used as a speed boost for the items. The more you have in a row, the faster they'll hit.

All rails also have friction, so if power rails aren't used all the time, the items will slow down, and eventually go to their normal speed.


## Creating the Crafting Machine

The crafting machine can be crafted with this recipe. To use it, just place it down.


## Choosing what to craft

You can change what the crafting machine will make by simply configuring the layout of the items in the 3x3 square in the centre, like you would in a normal crafting table.


## So how does this all go together

As you can see here, if you feed items into the Crafting Machine, it will keep accepting them. When a activator rail then gets activated next to it, it will pull out the crafted item, assuming there is enough items to make it.

The crafted item can them be moved into a chest!

The Crafting Machine will only take items specificed in the recipe, other items will be rejected entry.

The Crafting Machine also keep 1 copy of the item, so that it can use it as a template.
